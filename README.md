# gokart

The Arduino code for a gokart project we did. We used a HC05 serial bluetooth module, HC-SR04 ultrasonic range sensor (same as in my waterlever controller project)

I used a generic android app to send HEX values to the bluetooth module using which i can kill the engine and also resist from starting. Also used the SR04 sensor whic was connected to a buzzer to act similar to a parking sensor.
